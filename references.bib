	abstract="This paper focuses on the numerical analysis of a finite element method with stabilization for the unsteady incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. Incompressibility and convective effects are both stabilized adding an interior penalty term giving L                        2-control of the jump of the gradient of the approximate solution over the internal faces. Using continuous equal-order finite elements for both velocities and pressures, in a space semi-discretized formulation, we prove convergence of the approximate solution. The error estimates hold irrespective of the Reynolds number, and hence also for the incompressible Euler equations, provided the exact solution is smooth.",

Large-scale components (eddies, internal waves, and the wake) and fine-structure components are isolated in the flow patterns in near and away from the obstacle. The mechanism of formation of the propulsive force generating the self-motion of a free body at a neutral-buoyancy horizon is determined. The dependence of the flow parameters on the shape of the obstacle is shown. The transformation of the medium perturbation field at the beginning of the induced slow movement of the wedge at the neutral-buoyancy horizon is traced. The complex structures of fields of different physical quantities and their gradients are visualized. The intrinsic temporal and spatial scales of the flow components are identified.",
